## I'm Network Security EngineerðŸš€
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Netech - AkpÄ±nar BiliÅŸim Hizmetleri as an Network Security Engineer. 

During my work, I gained experience in network devices installation, configuration and monitoring. Then, I focused on Network Security and worked on the management and analysis of technologies such as Firewall, WAF, SIEM. Afterwards, I attended the C.E.H training and worked on pentesting, vulnerability management and malware analysis. In the future, I plan to specialize by continuing to work in the field of Cyber Security.

- My goals are to specialize in technologies such as SOC, SIEM and SOAR, to improve myself in the field of cyber security. ðŸŒŽ
